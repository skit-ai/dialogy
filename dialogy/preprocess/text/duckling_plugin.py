.. _duckling_plugin:

This module exposes a parser for `Duckling <https://github.com/facebook/duckling>`_.

`Duckling <https://github.com/facebook/duckling>`_ helps parsing values like: :code:`date`, :code:`time`,
:code:`numbers`, :code:`currency` etc. The parser will expect Duckling to be running as an http service, and provide
means to connect from the implementation here.

class DucklingPlugin(Plugin):
    """
    A :ref:`Plugin<plugin>` for extracting entities using `Duckling <https://github.com/facebook/duckling>`_. Once
    instantiated, a :code:`duckling_parser` object will interface to an http server, running `Duckling
    <https://github.com/facebook/duckling>`_.

    This object when used as a plugin, transforms the :code:`List[Dict[str, Any]]` returned from the API to a
    :ref:`BaseEntity<base_entity>` or one of its subclasses.

    :param dimensions: `Dimensions <https://github.com/facebook/duckling#supported-dimensions>`_. Of the listed
    dimensions, we support:

        - `Numeral`
        - `Time`
        - `TimeInterval`
        - `Duration`
        - `People` - This isn't part of the standard, we have a private fork to support this.

        Do note, passing more dimensions is not free. Duckling would search for extra set of patterns just because
        those dimensions were expected.
    :type dimensions: Optional[List[str]]

    :param locale: The format for expressing locale requires language code and country name ids. Read about
        `sections <https://github.com/facebook/duckling#extending-duckling>`_ that define
        `ISO-639-codes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes>`_ for languages and
        `ISO3166 alpha2 country code <https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search/code/>`_ for country codes.
        Examples: `"en_IN"`, `"en_US"`, `"en_GB"`.
    :type locale: str

    :param timezone: `pytz` Timezone. This is especially important when services are deployed across different
    geographies and consistency is expected in the responses. Get a valid value from a `list of tz database timezones
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones>`_. Example: `"Asia/Kolkata"` :type timezone:
    Optional[str]

    :param timeout: There are certain strings which tend to stall Duckling:
    `example <https://github.com/facebook/duckling/issues/338>`_.
    In such cases, to prevent the overall experience to slow
    down as well, provide a certain timeout value, defaults to 0.5.
