.. _workflow:

A :code:`workflow` is supposed to run tasks that can be anticipated well in advance.

Here are few demo's where you can see mock :code:`workflow` in action.

- :ref:`RuleBasedSlotFillerPlugin<rule_slot_filler>`
- :ref:`VotePlugin<vote_plugin>`
- :ref:`DucklingPlugin<duckling_plugin>`

A workflow is a hollow conduit, think of a vertically hanging pipe without any medium. If you were to drop a block of ...
`anything`? through it, it would pass through with a thud on the ground `(yes we assumed gravity)`.

Structure
----------

A workflow allows flexibility, that's why. There is very little structure to it. We have:

- input
- output
- plugins

Apart from these, we expect at the core, an inference function with machine learning models. Which ones? A N Y ones.
As long as you have the compute, there is no restriction. Use statistical models or DL or a bunch of conditions,
your :ref:`Workflow <Workflow>` won't judge you.

Advantages
-----------

The :ref:`Plugin<plugin>` concept takes care of the sauciness üçÖ of this project. Any functionality can be bundled into
a :ref:`Plugin<plugin>` and they are portable over to foreign workflows. A :ref:`Plugin<plugin>` proxies inputs through
an :code:`access` function (an argument to every :ref:`Plugin<plugin>`) and relays output through a :code:`mutate`
function (another argument for every :ref:`Plugin<plugin>`). These two functions define interactions between many many
(sic) :ref:`Plugins<plugin>` without knowing the inner workings of a :ref:`Workflow <workflow>`.

Take a look at :ref:`DucklingPlugin <duckling_plugin>`, this plugin handles inputs, manages the default :code:`json` output
into neatly bundled :ref:`BaseEntity <base_entity>` and other similar classes. Another plugin
:ref:`RuleBasedSlotFillerPlugin<rule_slot_filler>` takes care of slot names and the entity types that should be filled
within.

If your classifier predicts an :ref:`Intent<intent>` with :ref:`Slots<slot>` supporting any of those entities, then
slot-filling is not a worry.

The aim of this project is to be largest supplier of plugins for SLU applications.

.. warning:: The :ref:`Workflow<workflow>` class is not supposed to be used as it is. Ideally it should have been an
    abstract class. There are some design considerations which make that a bad choice. We want methods to be overridden
    to offer flexibility of use.
