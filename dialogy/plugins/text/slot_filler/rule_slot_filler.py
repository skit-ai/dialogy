Slot Filling
============

While we describe :ref:`slots <Slot>` in the linked doc. The slot filling is part of an :ref:`intent's<Intent>`
role. This plugin orchestrates the execution of slot filling via methods available on intents.

#. We eagerly apply slot placeholders using the :ref:`apply<ApplySlot>` method. 
#. Once entities are found, we check if the slots can fill them using the :ref:`fill<FillSlot>` method.
#. If no slots were filled, we remove the placeholders using :ref:`cleanup<CleanupSlot>` method.

    This plugin can assist filling pertaining to certain intent:entity:slot-name association rules.

    Let's run through a practical example. We will create a workflow and preset the output to have expected intent and
    entities.
