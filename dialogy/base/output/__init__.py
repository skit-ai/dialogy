"""
The :ref:`Output <Output>` class creates immutable instances that describe the output of a single turn of a conversation.
The output contains 

#. :code:`List[Intent]` sorted in descending order of confidence scores.
#. :code:`List[BaseEntity]` in an arbitrary order.

We don't require the :code:`List[BaseEntity]` apart from logging purposes. We fill relevant entities within :ref:`slots <Slot>`
of the predicted :ref:`Intent<Intent>`. Currently this is done only for the :ref:`Intent<Intent>` with the highest confidence score.
That's because currently, we only process a single trigger from the SLU API (at the dialog manager), which is an :ref:`Intent<Intent>`.

.. admonition:: Why do I see :ref:`Input <Input>` and :ref:`Output <Output>` as inputs to all :ref:`Plugins <AbstractPlugin>`?

    It is a common pattern for all the plugins to require both as arguments. Since this could be confusing nomenclature, :ref:`Input <Input>`
    and :ref:`Output <Output>` bear meaning and even separation for the SLU API, **not for** :ref:`Plugins <AbstractPlugin>`.

Setting Output
--------------

Just like :ref:`Input <Input>`, :ref:`Output <Output>` is also an immutable class.

#. **Don't change the attribute elements in place.** It would work for now
   but even types like `Intent` and `BaseEntity` will soon become immutable as well.

#. Plugins that produce output must always produce a :code:`List[Intent]` or :code:`List[BaseEntity]`.
   Say, returning a single :code:`Intent` would break validations on the output class.


Serialization
-------------

If there is a need to represent an :ref:`Input<Input>` as a `dict` we can do the following:

.. ipython::

    In [1]: from dialogy.base import Output
       ...: from dialogy.types import Intent

    In [2]: output = Output(intents=[Intent(name="_greeting_", score=1.0)])

    In [3]: output.json()
