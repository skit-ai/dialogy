"""
The :ref:`Input <Input>` class creates immutable instances that describe the inputs of a single turn of a conversation.
There are some attributes that may have aggregations of previous turns like the :code:`slot_tracker` or entire :code:`history`.

.. admonition:: Why do I see :ref:`Input <Input>` and :ref:`Output <Output>` as inputs to all :ref:`Plugins <AbstractPlugin>`?

    It is a common pattern for all the plugins to require both as arguments. Since this could be confusing nomenclature, :ref:`Input <Input>`
    and :ref:`Output <Output>` bear meaning and even separation for the SLU API, **not for** :ref:`Plugins <AbstractPlugin>`.


Updates
-------

While writing plugins, we would need to update the attributes of :ref:`Input <Input>`, the following **doesn't** work!

.. ipython::

    In [1]: from dialogy.base import Input
       ...: from dialogy.utils import make_unix_ts

    In [2]: # Check the attributes in the object logged below. 
       ...: input_x = Input(utterances="hello world", lang="hi", timezone="Asia/Kolkata")

    In [3]: input_x

Issues with Frozen Instance Update
##################################

Now if we try the following:

.. ipython::
    :okexcept:

    In [4]: input_x.utterances = "hello"

We can see re-assigning values to attributes isn't allowed. 

Updating a frozen instance
##########################

We have to create new instances, but we have some syntax for it: 

.. ipython::

    In [1]: input_x = Input(utterances="hello world", lang="hi", timezone="Asia/Kolkata")

    In [2]: input_y = Input.from_dict({"utterances": "hello"})

    In [3]: input_y

but by doing this, we lost the :code:`lang` and :code:`timezone` attributes to system defaults.

Reusing an existing instance
############################

We can re-use an existing instance to create a new.
This way, we don't have to write every existing property on a previous :ref:`Input <Input>`.

.. ipython::

    In [1]: input_x = Input(utterances="hello world", lang="hi", timezone="Asia/Kolkata")

    In [2]: input_y = Input.from_dict({"utterances": "hello"}, reference=input_x)

    In [3]: input_y

Serialization
-------------

If there is a need to represent an :ref:`Input<Input>` as a `dict` we can do the following:

.. ipython::

    In [4]: input_y.json()
