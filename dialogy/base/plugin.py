.. _plugin:

Module provides access to an abstract plugin class.

We will summarize a few key points for creating plugins:

-   Don't interact with the workflow directly, use functions to access and mutate.
-   The convention for workflow access is `access(workflow)`.
-   The convention for workflow modification is `mutate(workflow, value)`.
-   Plugin names must end with Plugin for classes and _plugin for functions.

examples:
- Sentence2VecPlugin
- words2num_plugin
- RuleSlotFilerPlugin
- VotePlugin

class Plugin:
    """
    A :ref:`Plugin <plugin>` instance interacts with a :ref:`workflow<workflow>`. A :ref:`workflow<workflow>` expects
    a set of plugins to be inserted into different stages: pre and post processing.
    A plugin can be conveniently written being unaware of the structure of any :ref:`Workflow <workflow>`
    by expecting `access` and `mutate` functions.

    **Dynamic Inputs**

    An :code:`access` method helps a :ref:`Plugin <plugin>` to require dynamic inputs from the :ref:`workflow<workflow>`
    while a :code:`mutate` method offers a :ref:`Plugin <plugin>` to update the processed output and place them as per
    expectations of the :ref:`workflow<workflow>` implementer's design.

    **Static Inputs**

    In case there are static inputs that won't change at runtime, these can be pre-loaded into the
    :ref:`Plugin <plugin>` by extending it.

    An example for this is:

    .. code-block:: python
        :linenos:
        :emphasize-lines: 14, 20

        class CustomPlugin(Plugin):
            def __init__(
                self,
                access: Optional[PluginFn],

                The `.load_corpus()` method reads some corpus.
                This is useful since we expect to read this
                just once and use it throughout the runtime.
