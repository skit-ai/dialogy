Intent Classification
======================

Automatic categorization of texts into known classes. When solving SLU problems
the objective is to answer *What was meant?* instead of *"What was said?"*. 

For an example utterance *"I lost my wallet"* a bank's support executives would 
understand that they must follow the operating procedure for blocking all transaction 
accounts. We want to train machines to have the ability to interpret these cues.

We call the classes of *meaning* as :code:`Intent`.

We can obtain intents from :ref:`XLMRMultiClass<XLMRMultiClass>` and :ref:`MLPMultiClass<MLPMultiClass>` plugin.
