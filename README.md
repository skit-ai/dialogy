Dialogy is a library for building and managing SLU applications.
[Documentation](https://skit-ai.github.io/dialogy/)

## Installation

```shell
pip install dialogy
```

Dialogy's CLI supports building and migration of projects. Migration is hard because a few modules need a forced update but a few others
should be retained by the developer. The lack of this expression makes it hard to migrate smoothly. Building new projects should be fairly simple.

```txt
dialogy -h
usage: dialogy [-h] {create,update,train} ...

positional arguments:
  {create,update,train}
                        Dialogy project utilities.
    create              Create a new project.
    update              Migrate an existing project to the latest template version.
    train               Train a workflow.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
```

## Project Creation

```txt
dialogy create -h
usage: dialogy create [-h] [--template TEMPLATE] [--dry-run] [--namespace NAMESPACE] [--master] project

positional arguments:
  project               A directory with this name will be created at the root of command invocation.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --template TEMPLATE
  --dry-run             Make no change to the directory structure.
  --namespace NAMESPACE
                        The github/gitlab user or organization name where the template project lies.
  --master              Download the template's master branch (HEAD) instead of the latest tag.
```

## Building

To build SLU pipelines using Dialogy, you would need to understand the building blocks.

1. Input
2. Output
3. Plugin
4. Workflow 

### Input

A class that contains initial values / placeholders for the pipeline.

### Output

A class that contains the results / placeholders for the pipeline.

### Plugin

- A Plugin is an abstract class with an abstract method `def utility(i: Input, o: Output) -> Any`.
- Initialize your class with artifact paths, reading files, loading models, etc. 
- At runtime we call the `utility` method to get the results.

### Workflow

- A workflow is a map over all the plugins in a sequence, as desired by the pipeline creator. 
- The workflow iterates over each plugin, calls its `utility` method.
- Each plugin sets the value within the workflow automatically.

## Test

```shell
make test
```

## Contributors

Clone the repository. We use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to setup dependencies.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:skit-ai/dialogy.git
cd dialogy
# Activate your virtualenv, you can also let poetry take care of it.
poetry install
make test
```
Ensure tests are passing before you start working on your PRs.
