    A Plugin class example.

    We can create Plugins using python classes. If we extend from
    the [`Plugin`](../dialogy/plugin/plugin.html) class, we get the `access` and `mutate`
    attributes.

    The `access` and `mutate` values are set to `None` because there are cases where you may
    only need to perform computation. Say metric plugins, which could be a set of post-processing
    plugins that evaluate the workflow but have nothing to insert into it.

    These utilities would be forced to hack a value around to satisfy the type-checking, this
    can be avoided by expecting either of the functions to be of type `NoneType` or `PluginFn`.
