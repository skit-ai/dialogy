Dialogy is a batteries-included opinionated framework to build machine-learning solutions for speech applications.

-   Plugin-based: Makes it easy to import/export components to other projects.
-   Stack-agnostic: No assumptions made on ML stack; your choice of machine learning library will not be affected by using Dialogy.
-   Progressive: Minimal boilerplate writing to let you focus on your machine learning problems.

Starting projects
**************************

We have a `template <https://github.com/Vernacular-ai/dialogy-template-simple-transformers>`_
that can help you get started with a SLU project.

.. code-block:: shell

   dialogy create <your_project_name> dialogy-template-simple-transformers

An interactive session will collect a few details and create a project scaffolding ready to use.

.. note:: Popular workflow sub-classes will be accepted after code-review.
